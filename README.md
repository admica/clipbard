## 🚀 Installation

### Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
{
  "admica/clipbard.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("clipbard").setup()
  end,
}
```

### Using [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

```lua
use {
  'admica/clipbard.nvim',
  config = function() require('clipbard').setup() end
}
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Clipbard works out of the box with no additional configuration. However, if you want to customize its behavior, you can pass options to the setup function:

```lua
require('clipbard').setup({
  -- Options here, coming soon™
})
```

## 📖 Usage

Once installed and set up, Clipbard will automatically enhance your clipboard experience. Use Vim as you normally would, and enjoy the seamless integration with your system clipboard!

- `y` (yank) and yy
- `d` (delete)
- `c` (change)
- `x` (delete character)

All these operations will now also copy the affected text to your system clipboard.
